# Lab 3: Uploading sensor data to cloud**

<p align="center">In this lab, you will work with a WiFi module to make a sensor-cloud architecture IoT application.
TTGO T-Display Board provides a built-in WiFi module to connect the board to the Internet. In this assignment you will follow three steps:

A. Connect your ESP32 TTGO board to the Internet using HTTP protocol.
B. Setup a cloud-based web application.
C. Make an application for ESP32 board to sense the temperature and humidity and
monitor the collected data at a web-based application.</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

You should make a system which records data from temperature and humidity sensors and sends the collected data to a web server and prints them on the console on the cloud side (either AWS or Azure). First, you will have to design the wiring diagram to interface with the TTGO board.
